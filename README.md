### Controllable characters

We have a player that you control in the first person and you are able to toggle a flashlight on and off as the player.

## Moving part 1

We have a light source in the form a flashlight that follows the player around and it can be turned on and off using right click.

## Moving part 2

You go around the scene looking for 5 keys and when the 5 keys are found a door opens letting you escape into a backyard area that has a fire.

## Interactions
You can pick up the keys and also interact with the door to open it once you have all the keys.
